# 🏆 Women Safety Analytics - Gender and Mask Detection System.

This project was developed as part of the **Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2024** and won first prize! 🎉 Our goal was to create real-time threat detection software to help improve women’s safety in public spaces through gender and mask detection using live video feeds.

## 🔍 Overview

The system leverages deep learning models to identify if a person is wearing a mask and to predict gender in real-time. This innovative approach aims to increase safety by monitoring potential health and security protocols in crowded places.

## 🚀 Features

- **Gender Detection**: Uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify gender as either 'Male' or 'Female' based on facial detection.
- **Mask Detection**: Recognizes whether a person is wearing a mask, using a separate deep learning model.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Utilizes OpenCV for seamless, real-time video processing, showing detection results on the screen instantly.

## 📦 Requirements

To run this project, you'll need:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- Numpy

Make sure you have the correct version of **Haar Cascade** for face detection, which will automatically download if you install OpenCV.

### 💻 Installation

To install the required libraries on **Windows, Mac, or Linux**, simply run the following command:

```command
pip install opencv-python
```
```numpy
pip install numpy
```
```tensorflow
pip install tensorflow
```
## 🎥 Running the Application

1. **Start the detection script** by following the instructions in the source files.
2. **Enable Video Mode**: When prompted, select "Y" to use your camera.
3. **View Real-Time Results**: Detected faces will display gender and mask status.
4. **Exit**: Press **Q** to close the window.

## 🔑 Note

For project security and to keep the code proprietary, the exact implementation details are excluded here. This document provides instructions to set up and use the system, enabling seamless interaction with the models.

## 🎉 Achievements

This project showcases the powerful intersection of machine learning and real-time analytics in enhancing public safety, and we’re excited to have won first prize at **SIH 2024** for our efforts!
